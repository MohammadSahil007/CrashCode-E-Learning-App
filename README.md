### Project Description:
This is an E-Learning app built with React Native that provides interactive learning resources for programming languages such as Java, C, and C++. The app aims to help users learn these languages from basic to intermediate levels. It features:

- **Theory**: Detailed explanations and lessons for Java, C, and C++, covering fundamental concepts, syntax, and more advanced topics.
- **MCQs**: Multiple-choice questions for practicing and reinforcing programming knowledge.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive and engaging design, making learning easier and enjoyable.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built with React Native, the app is compatible with both Android and iOS devices.

### Key Features:
1. **Programming Language Theory**:
   - Covers key concepts in Java, C, and C++ from the ground up.
   - Provides clear explanations, examples, and diagrams where necessary.
   
2. **MCQ Practice**:
   - Test your understanding of programming concepts with multiple-choice questions.
   - Questions are divided into categories based on difficulty (Basic, Intermediate).

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - A smooth, mobile-friendly interface that works seamlessly across Android and iOS.

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Keep track of your learning progress and revisit previous lessons and quizzes.

### Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: (If you have one, specify it, e.g., Node.js, Firebase, etc.)
- **Database**: (If you're using a database, e.g., Firebase Firestore, SQLite, etc.)
